# DoctorCare 
**DoctorCare** is a landing page for a medical assistance service. 
It was built as a personal project to strengthen my knowledge of **Webpack5**, **HTML5**, **Sass/SCSS**, and **JavaScript**.

![DoctorCare](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86603696/236229624-c3bd510f-66a2-4e60-8df8-b84307ea46b3.png)

The [template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1102912263666619803) for the site was developed by RocketSeat, a Brazilian company known for their expertise in web development.


## Motivation üîç
The main motivation for this project was to improve my understanding of Webpack5 and how it can be used to manage and bundle web application assets. 

As part of my learning process, I'm using this project as an opportunity to practice writing Sass/SCSS using BEM (Block Element Modify) and the 7-1 Patterns Architecture. BEM is a naming convention that helps to create reusable and modular CSS, while the 7-1 Patterns Architecture is a well-established way of organizing Sass/SCSS files into smaller, more manageable parts. 

By following these best practices, I hope to improve my front-end development skills and create a more robust and maintainable project.
